# Refractor-SEO-HW

## Description

Our challenge for this project was to replace all divs with semantic elements. The objective was to modify this website and make it accessible. 

### HTML
The syntax I changed in the HTML file was :
    - Switching out the div elements and correctly placing the right semantic elements in it's place. Such as the <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>.
    -  Added the "alt" attributes that were missing in the <img> tags of the   assignment.
    - Changed some class selectors to id selectors.
    - Changing all of the heading titles to make sure that they were in sequential order.
     
### CSS
The syntax I changed in the CSS file were :

     - Changing the heading in the footer section from <h2> to <h4>
     - Including the <nav>, and <ul> tags with the header element
     - Swithing out periods (.) with hashtags (#). In addition, switching "class=" attributes to "id=" id's.
